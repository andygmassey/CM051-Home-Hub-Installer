# The assistant's own sends are dropped by the conversation readers

**Hand-built 2026-10-14. Location and shape only, never content.**

Trees: `imessage_source`, `whatsapp_source`, `email_source` (this file), and
`ostler_fda` (recorded in `WRITER_READER_MISMATCHES.UNRECORDED.md`, the record
that tree already points at).

## What changed, per file

| tree | file | change |
|---|---|---|
| `imessage_source` | `reader.py` | new `ASSISTANT_SEND_PREFIX`, `ASSISTANT_SEND_MARKER`, `is_assistant_send()`; `extract_messages` skips rows it matches and logs a count |
| `ostler_fda` | `imessage.py` | the same constants and predicate; `extract_messages` skips matching rows |
| `whatsapp_source` | `reader.py` | imports `is_assistant_send` from `ostler_fda.imessage`; `_read_bodies_for_chat` skips matching bodies |
| `email_source` | `reader.py` | imports the same predicate; `read_messages` skips a message whose body matches |

## Why

The morning brief and the evening wrap go out by iMessage to the owner's own
number, from the owner's Apple ID, so chat.db stores them as `is_from_me=1`
and the readers bundled them as the owner speaking. Walk #27 (Mini16,
2026-10-14): 141 such sends plus 148 inbound copies, 9 bundles, 7 facts.

The marker is what the sender stamps: ostler-assistant
`crates/zeroclaw-channels/src/imessage.rs` prefixes every outbound iMessage
with the identity prefix (default the robot emoji), and its own echo guard
already treats a leading robot emoji as the assistant's. The invisible
`ASSISTANT_SEND_MARKER` is appended at send time by ostler-assistant (separate
PR) so a customer who empties the visible prefix is still covered.

## Why there is no patch

`scripts/regenerate_divergence_patch.sh <tree>` was run (dry) on 2026-10-14
with `HR015` and `CM040` pointed at local checkouts:

| tree | outcome |
|---|---|
| `whatsapp_source` | **REFUSED**: the proposed patch carries an email-shaped value on the source side |
| `imessage_source` | would record ~500 lines of earlier, unrelated, unrecorded drift (tick throttle, #789) as deliberate; not mine to bless |
| `email_source` | same shape as `imessage_source` |

Test: `tests/test_assistant_sends_are_not_owner_input.py`.
Upstream mirror owed: CM040 `services/imessage_source/reader.py`, HR015
`whatsapp_source/reader.py`, `email_source/reader.py`, `ostler_fda/imessage.py`.
